Easter Quest 2015
"Limited" quest featuring an easter bunny. Awards realm-wide rewards, such as the ability for monsters to now drop easter eggs. Easter eggs will follow the same rarity and buy/sell value as the same craft/disenchant values in Hearthstone
One Helping Hand
A parody of One Small Favour in Runescape. Features an NPC who asks for an emergency favour that he claims will be "very fast", with the player panicking and close to declining the quest, claiming he knows what will happen and that one favour will just lead to another, and thus he doesn't want to do favours at all. Ends up with the player accepting the quest, ableit very relucklantly. When the player gets to the next NPC, the NPC, as expected, asks for another favour, which the player moans and bitches about on the spot. The player accepts this new favour and moves on, constantly moaning on how this quest is about to be very long and annoying. On the 3rd NPC, the NPC is willing to help the player on the spot, with no extra favours required, leaving the player very surprised. The player quickly suspects this is a trap, but soon discovers it is indeed real and can return to complete the quests. Once back at the original NPC, the NPc notes that the quest was completed realy quickly, and tells the player that he was right, that the quest will be very quick, which the player agrees.
