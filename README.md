GRPG is a top down 2d open world game inspired by RuneScape, allowing players to explore, gather resources and kill monsters to gain experience and become stronger in their multiple skills. This complex game was developed within a 3 week assignment to challenge a 3 man team, and was eventually one of the game showcased in Ngee Ann's Graduation Showcase on March 2015, and also selected to be one of the featured projects to be publicized to the public and put up on the public facing website.
